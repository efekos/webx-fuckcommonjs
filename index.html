    <h1>FUCK COMMONJS</h1>

    <p>
        Fuck commonjs. No I'm serious, actuall fuck commonjs. Fuck everyone who uses commonjs on purpose. Fuck everyone who contributed to commonjs. everyone who found commonjs. Fuck everyone who still supports commonjs. Fuck ALL of them, NONE of them deserve any respect, like bro. Just imagine. Imagine making a way better module system than "common" js that everyone loves, appreciates and wants to use, just to not support it in every possible way for 10 fucking years.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have no fucking idea why someone would create this bullshit called "common" js to make everyone absolutely hate it. I hate this shit in every way. Like BRO, WHY THE FUCK WOULD I NEED A FUCKING FUNCTION WHEN YOUR BULLSHIT LANGUAGE ALREADY SUPPORTS FUCKING IMPORT STATEMENTS. HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU BE THIS DUMB. YOU LITERALLY SPEND THREE FUCKING MONTHS MAKING A PARSER FOR THAT FUCKING IMPORT STATEMENT, JUST TO SAY "Uhhmmü§ìü§ìü§ì‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è achuallhyü§ì‚òùÔ∏è you can't use imphmort statemhents ü§ìüëì‚òùÔ∏èüëì‚òùÔ∏è in a ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏èüëìüëì commonjs module" LIKE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE AN ABSOLUTE SHITDUMP TO DO THIS TORTURE TO ME.
    </p>

    <p>
        Importing isn't a problem, it's mostly done by webpack and html code anyway. But DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED with these stupid fucking needles exporting logic. You don't have to listen to me. Let's see how other languages export stuff.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In TypeScript, you use an export keyword</li>
        <li>In Java,C,C++,Python and Ruby, you don't even have to explicitly add a keyword. Your shit is already exported either by the code IDE puts to new files or the language.</li>
        <li>In Swift, your shit is already exported to the module. You can use public to export it to other modules.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But in this bullshit called "common" js, you have to define your bullshit as A FUCKING VALUE TO ANOTHER OBJECT. LIKE THIS HAS BE THE MOST STUPID THING. WHY WOULD THIS EVEN MAKE SENSE TO SOMEONE. THIS ISN'T EVEN LOGICALLY EXPORTING, YOU LITERALLY PUT YOUR SHIT TO A GLOBAL HASHMAP.
